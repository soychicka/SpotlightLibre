Spotlight Full Text Search Plugin
==============================

Created by soychicka (August 2019)

Requires Calibre >= 3.41.3 (as tested, it may run on earlier versions.  Lemme know if it doesn't?)

Runs only on OS X systems (uses spotlight which is only available in OS X).

This plugin lets you run a full text search in Calibre that uses your Mac's pre-existing Spotlight index to look inside your documents, displaying the matches in calibre.


Install

Steps to get this plugin working:
1. install plugin

			Column type: "Column built from other columns"
			Template: {id}   # include brackets
			Sort/Search column by: number


3.  Use it
